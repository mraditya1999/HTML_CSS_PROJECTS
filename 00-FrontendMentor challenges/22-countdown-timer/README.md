### What I learned

Through this project, I have acquired proficiency in utilizing the Date object to intricately format date and time, a skill pivotal for tasks such as crafting countdown timers and establishing precise date formats.

```css
height: clamp(4rem, 15vw, 10rem);
width: clamp(4rem, 15vw, 10rem);
```

```js
function format(value) {
  if (value < 10) return (value = `0${value}`);
  return `${value}`;
}
```
