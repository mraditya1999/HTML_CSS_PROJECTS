### What I learned

In the preceding segment, I acquired knowledge encompassing card validation, frontend error handling, and the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM).

```js
function showError(element, message) {
  element.nextElementSibling.textContent = message;
  element.nextElementSibling.classList.add('active');
}

function hideError(element) {
  element.nextElementSibling.textContent = '';
  element.nextElementSibling.classList.remove('active');
}
```

### Continued development

I have successfully concluded the task; however, there exists a noticeable redundancy within the code that necessitates refactoring. I am now sufficiently poised and confident to proceed with the refactoring process.
