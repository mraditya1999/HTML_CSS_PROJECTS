### What I learned

I've learn implenting different images according to different viewport screen size using html 'picture' tag

```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="./images/bg-section-top-desktop-1.svg"
    media="(min-width: 768px)"
  />
  <img src="./images/bg-section-top-mobile-1.svg" alt="" />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

I have successfully integrated curved backgrounds within the designated section; however, I seek to enhance my proficiency in their implementation. I am eager to acquire the most effective methodologies for incorporating curved sections, which will undoubtedly bolster my confidence in this endeavor.
